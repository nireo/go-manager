# go-manager
Go-manager is a task manager fully built in go with minimal required dependencies. 

## Requirements
Go-manager has only been tested on Linux and more specifically Arch Linux, so if there are problems on other distributions or operating systems, please inform me in the 'issues' tab.

Also to compile and run the code you need to have golang installed

## Running
To build the code you need the the following dependencies:
```
go get -u https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil
go get -u https://github.com/termui/v3
```
With these downloaded you should be able to then run: `go run main.go`, but you can also build the application by running: `go build main.go`
